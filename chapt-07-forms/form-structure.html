<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get">
    <p>This is where the form controls will appear.</p>
</form>

<!-- The action attribute is the URL for the page on the server
     that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.

     The method attribute can use "get" or "post"

     - With the get method, the values from the form are added to
       the end of the URL specified in the action attribute
     - "get" method is ideal for short forms (search boxes)
     -          --||--      , when you are just retrieving data
        from the web server (not sending information that should be
        added to or deleted from a database)

     - With the post method, the values are sent in what are known
       as HTTP headers
     - "post" method, when the form allows users to upload a file
     -             --||--           is very long, contains sensitive
       data (e.g. passwords)
     -             --||--           adds info to, or deletes info from DB

     By default, the method is set to "get" -->
