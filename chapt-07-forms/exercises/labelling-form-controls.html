<!-- Each form control should have its own <label> element.
     
    The <label> element can be used in two ways. It can:
    1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input (line 1)
    2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute 
    to indicate which form control it is a label for. (line 7 & 10)
    
    The value of the for attribute matches that of the (!!)id(!!) attribute
    on the form control it is labelling.
    When a <label> element is used with a checkbox or radio button, users 
    can click on either the form control or the label to select.
