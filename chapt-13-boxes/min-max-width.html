            <td class="description">The Rhodes piano is an electro-mechanical
                piano, invented by Harold Rhodes during the fifties and later
                manufactured in a number of models, first in collaboration with
                Fender and after 1965 by CBS. It employs a piano-like keyboard
                with hammers that hit small metal tines, amplified by
                electromagnetic pickups.</td>
