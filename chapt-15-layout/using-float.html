    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

    <p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that 
        would help him get around the royal gardens faster: 
        two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, 
        mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. </p>

    <p>The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, 
        thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort 
        of gliding walk.</p>

    <p>The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). 
        It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived 
        popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation 
        in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in 
        a park or garden.</p>

    <p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 
        1865, when pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. 
        They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to 
        roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>

    <p> This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") 
        as well as the "bone shaker," since its wooden structure 
        combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an 
        extremely uncomfortable ride.</p>

    <p>Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel 
        provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.</p>
