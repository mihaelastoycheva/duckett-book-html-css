     than the space you have allowed for it

     It can take one of three values: 
        yes (to show scrollbars), 
        no (to hide scrollbars),
        auto (to show them only if needed). 
        
    
     Frameborder attribute: A value of 0 indicates that no border should
     be shown. A value of 1 indicates that a border should be shown 
     
     (In HTML5) Seamless attribute: applied to an iframe where scrollbars
     are not desired. -->
