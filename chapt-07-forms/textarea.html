    <p>What did you think of this gig?</p>

    <textarea name="comments" cols="20" rows="4">Enter your comments...</textarea>
</form>

<!-- The <textarea> element creates a multi-line text input. (have an opening and a closing tag !!)
     OLD CODE: The cols attribute indicates how wide the text area should be.
               The rows attribute indicates how many rows the text area should take up vertically. -->
