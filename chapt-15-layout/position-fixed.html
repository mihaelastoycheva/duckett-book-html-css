<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>

<p class="example">In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that
    would help him get around the royal gardens faster:
    two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable,
    mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device
    was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground,
    thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort
    of gliding walk.</p>

<p class="example">The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse").
    It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived
    popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation
    in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in
    a park or garden.</p>

<p class="example">The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in
    1865, when pedals were applied directly to the front wheel.
    This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot")
    as well as the "bone shaker," since its wooden structure
    combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an
    extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and
    indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be
    found in large cities.</p>
