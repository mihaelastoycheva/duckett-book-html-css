1. p {font-family: Arial;}'
   ^             ^
  selector    declaration

This rule indicates that all <p> elements should be shown in the
Arial typeface.

2. h1, h2, h3 {font-family: Arial;
               color:       yellow;}
                  ^           ^
              property       value

This rule indicates that all <h1>, <h2> and <h3> elements should be 
shown in the Arial typeface, in a yellow color.

3. CSS Cascade
    - Last rule: If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take
    precedence;

    - Specificity: If one selector is more specific than the others, the more 
    specific rule will take precedence over more general ones;

    - Important: You can add !important after any property value to indicate
    that it should be considered more important than other rules.

4. Why external styles?
    - All of your web pages can share the same style sheet. This is achieved 
    by using the <link> element on each HTML page of your site to link to the 
    same CSS document.
    - Sometimes you might consider placing CSS rules in the same page as
    your HTML code.

5. Test your website in different browsers:
    - BrowserCam.com
    - BrowserLab.Adobe.com
    - BrowserShots.org
    - CrossBrowserTesting.com

When a CSS property does not display as expected, it is generally referred to as a
browser quirk or CSS bug.
