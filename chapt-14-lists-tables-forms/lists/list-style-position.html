<!--
    The list-style- position property indicates whether the marker should appear on the inside or the outside
    of the box.
    - outside (default): The marker sits to the left of the block of text
    - inside: The marker sits inside the box of text (which is indented)

    *Margin has been added to each list item so that there is a clear gap between each.
